#sublime-marko
Syntax highlighting for [Marko-js](https://github.com/marko-js/marko)

##Installation
For now you need to drop `Marko.tmLanguage` into your 'Sublime Text 3/Packages/User' folder (where you store your snippets). I am working on getting this into Package Control and will update this file when that is completed.
